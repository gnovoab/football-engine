- Rosters: loaded from ./rosters/*.json (external folder).
- Each league:

    - 38 rounds (double round-robin), second leg reshuffled, avoid immediate rematches.
- Fixture:

- Match timing:
    - Real-time: 45m + 30s HT + 45m + stoppage time (basic)
- Snapshots:
    - MATCH_SNAPSHOT every 10 seconds
- Orchestration:
    - one fixture at a time per league
    - 10 minutes between fixtures
    - 1 hour between seasons
    - 2 seasons per league
- APIs:
    - /api/runners/{league}/pause
    - /api/runners/{league}/stop (immediate)
    - /api/runners/{league}/resume
    - /api/runners/{league}/running-fixture (always 200; next countdown only when waiting; next=null if paused/stopped)
    - /api/runners/{league}/schedule (includes currentRound/nextRound; shows upcoming season schedule during season gap)
- WebSockets:
    - /ws/matches/*
    - /ws/leagues/*/fixtures/*
- UI:
